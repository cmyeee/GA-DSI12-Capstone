# GA-DSI12-Capstone

Hello! This repository stores the materials for my capstone project done during my DSI12+ course at General Assembly. I had created an Attrition Prediction Model based on fictional IBM data on Kaggle. 
The key product for this project is a web app, made using Flask, targeted for supervisors to check the probability of their staff resigning. 

## How to view my work
1. Download the files in this repository. 
2. Open a command prompt and bring yourself to the location where you saved the files. 
3. Make sure you have Flask installed. If it is not installed yet, key in **pip install flask**.
4. Once you made sure Flask is installed, key in **python app.py** then hit enter.
5. A local URL would be generated. Mine looked something like this: http://127.0.0.1:5008/. Copy that to your browser of choice and you can now use the web app!

If you have any queries, please feel free to contact me at cmyeee@gmail.com.

Thank you!
